# DSA-project
This is a project in class Data Structure and Algorithm
This project compare running time and the number of comparisons of 11 sort algorithms:
  -Selection Sort
  -Insertion Sort
  -Bubble Sort
  -Shaker Sort
  -Shell Sort
  -Heap Sort
  -Merge Sort
  -Quick Sort
  -Counting Sort
  -Radix Sort
  -Flash Sort.
  
Examine the selected sorting algorithms on different data arrangements, including: 
  -Sorted data (in ascending order)
  -Nearly sorted data
  -Reverse sorted data
  -Randomized data
  
  
Examine the selected sorting algorithms on data of the following sizes: 10,000, 30,000, 50,000, 100,000, 300,000, and 500,000 elements.
